<p align="center"> A small test for Python API development
</p>
<p>
Nork-Town is a weird place. Crows cawk the misty morning while old men squint. It’s a small town, so the mayor had a bright idea to limit the number of cars a person may possess. One person may have up to 3 vehicles. The vehicle, registered to a person, may have one color, ‘yellow’, ‘blue’ or ‘gray’. And one of three models, ‘hatch’, ‘sedan’ or ‘convertible’. Carford car shop want a system where they can add car owners and cars. Car owners may not have cars yet, they need to be marked as a sale opportunity. Cars cannot exist in the system without owners.

Requirements

● Setup the dev environment with docker
○ Using docker-compose with as many volumes as it takes
● Use Python’s Flask framework and any other library
